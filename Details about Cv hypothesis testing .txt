Hooker et al. (2018) derived 95% confidence intervals to Cv values for random fracture locations by generating N random locations 1000 times and using the 25th and 975th value of the sorted Cvâ€™s as measures of whether spacing values are distinguishable from random. In our case, the number N corresponds to the observed number of fractures on each tested scanline, i.e. wells, scanlines, etc. (Table 5). Only at Cv = 0 would fractures qualify as perfectly regularly spaced. But the Hooker et al. analysis puts an error interval on Cv values so they can be statistically distinguished from random. 

Since Cv distribution of random fracture locations is expected to be normal, we can also derive its 95% confidence interval by calculating the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile values from a normal distribution. The normal distribution takes the mean and standard deviation of the resulting Cv's. For each tested scanline, we generated N random locations 100 times, keeping the number of iterations consistent with the default 100 Monte Carlo randomizations in CorrCount for the Normalized Correlation Count (NCC) analysis.  

For hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis is that an observed natural fracture sequence is randomly distributed. If observed Cv value falls outside of the 95% confidence interval, then we reject the null hypothesis and say the observed fracture sequence is statistically distinguished from a random distribution. Table 5 reports a summary of Cv significance test result. 

A code for rapidly conducting this calculation was written and is available at https://github.com/callmekiki/FractureSpacingStatistics/blob/064531f6fb89fced47ccf5c4718978dfc16bd37f/Cv%20confidence%20interval%20for%20random%20fracture%20locations.
